## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Edit your `config.yaml`:**
   Define your credentials, limits, target accounts, sleep intervals, comments, and (optionally) your device profile.

3. **Create your execution script:**
   Make sure `run.sh` runs `main.py` and prevents overlapping executions.

4. **Schedule execution:**
   Add `run.sh` to your crontab to run every minute:
   ```bash
   * * * * * /path/to/grammy/run.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   The script will self-schedule a randomized run-time daily and auto-skip until it matches.

5. **Run manually (any time):**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --now
   ```

## ðŸ“± Device Emulation
You can optionally specify your own device profile to simulate a real phone. If not set, one is generated and saved automatically.

## ðŸ“‹ Housekeeping
Run this script to check daily interaction stats:
```bash
python3 housekeeping_report.py
```
